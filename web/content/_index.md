Layered schemas technology is a semantic interoperability tool for
data capture, processing, and exchange. It uses a schema to define
data elements and additional layers (overlays) to define open-ended
semantic annotations. These annotations can be used to 

  * classify data using various ontologies, 
  * harmonize variations due to different conventions, locale, and
    vendor implementations,
  * add directives for validation and custom processing, 
  * add metadata.
  

A layered schema defines a mapping from structured data to a knowledge
graph while adding metadata. This enables processing and linking data
from multiple domains independent of representation. Added semantic
information allows interpreting and processing data without the
precise structure of the source data. For example, it is possible to
use layeres schemas to ingest clinical health data, merge it with
wearable device data, and then mark certain attributes as
"identifiable" so they can be excluded from certain data exchange
scenarios.
